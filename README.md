# Hospitome
## Project Description
We as a team are working on project named Hospitome(Hospital & Home). In remote areas, the penetration of hospitals and doctors is low. We in this project aim to create a solution to increase the reach of medical facilities. Our project aims to create a solution that can easily detect range of diseases by taking user input with the help of an interactive bot and give reliable results using machine learning models.

Every sector is revolutionizing Data Science applications, including Healthcare, IT, Media, Entertainment, and many others.
Today, healthcare industries are utilizing the power of Data Science successfully, and in this project we are going to integrate the use of Data Science in Healthcare.

This Project uses machine learning models in detection of various diseases
1. Heart Diseases
2. Diabetes
3. Chronic Kidney Diseases
4. Lung Diseases
5. Liver Diseases

We will be using different machine learning algorithms such as random forest regression, k-neighbours classifiers. We will also be using image processing, neural networks.

## Technologies
* React
* Figma (UI/UX)
* Python (ML)
* Firebase

We have a basic idea of these tech stacks while we learn more about it as the project is in development
