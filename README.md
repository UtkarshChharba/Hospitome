# Hospitome
## Project Description
We as a team are working on project named Hospitome(Hospital & Home). In remote areas, the penetration of hospitals and doctors is low. We in this project aim to create a solution to increase the reach of medical facilities. Our project aims to create a solution that can easily detect range of diseases by taking user input with the help of an interactive bot and give reliable results using machine learning models.
